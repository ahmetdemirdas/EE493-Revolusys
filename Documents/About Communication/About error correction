With visible light communication as wireless communication channel you can
use all the forward error correction techniques. You can use block channel 
coding like RS code which is useful for correcting the burst errors.
You can use convolutional channel coding which has the capability to correct 
random bit errors. You can combine the two codes to achieve high correction 
capability. The strongest error correction coding is the turbo coding which 
has the ultimate gain.
The burst error can be randomized by using interleaves. So, it is normally 
to use interleavers with convolutional codes.
In fact you can use error detection and correction techniques to improve 
the transmission over channels with relatively low S/N ratio.

There is an article related to TURBO CODING mentioned above in the DOCUMENTS 
folder. It can be useful.
